# LendingClub-Loan-Data-Visualization

# About
Lending Club is a peer-to-peer Lending company based in the US. They match people looking to invest money with people looking to borrow money. When investors invest their money through Lending Club, this money is passed onto borrowers, and when borrowers pay their loans back, the capital plus the interest passes on back to the investors. It is a win for everybody as they can get typically lower loan rates and higher investor returns.
In this data analysis project, I have explored the dataset and used Tableau to create my visualizations.

# Dataset
The Lending Club dataset contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. Features (aka variables) include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes and state, and collections among others. Collections indicates whether the customer has missed one or more payments and the team is trying to recover their money. The file is a matrix of about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables.

# Summary
* Most of the loans issued were in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 USD.
* The year of 2014 was the year were most loans were issued.
* Loans were issued in an incremental manner. (Possible due to a recovery in the U.S economy)
* The loans applied by potential borrowers, the amount issued to the borrowers and the amount funded by investors are similarly distributed, meaning that it is most likely that qualified borrowers are going to get the loan they had applied for.
